This repository is part of <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/home">The Odin Project</a>. This project utilizes Ruby on Rails to build a site similar to a private <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> which enables users to create events and send invitations. The site has been styled through the use of Bootstrap and borrows from the Hartl Tutorial's CSS code.
